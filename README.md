## Angular-Boilerplate

This is a base template for Angular 2. It contains the core files you will need when starting an Angular 2 project.

I made this boilerplate so that I'll have the dependencies when working on Angular project.

### Installation of Libraries and Dependencies

Once you have the files downloaded, navigate into the root project directory and run the following command. This will
install all libraries and dependencies.

`npm install`

### Run the Project

Now you can start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode and run lite-server with automatic refreshing.

`npm start`
